### <span style="color: blue;">Background</span>
##### <span style="color: gray;">Some early runs from EPICC had RT-PCR data exported without accounting for the automatically determined baseline correction. In most cases, the QuantStudio software is able to appropriately determine CT values before the logarithmic increase in signal is detected. However, in some cases the software selects this value incorrectly and counts some of the logarithmic increase as noise. This creates a "double waterfall" effect in the data where a logarithmic decrease in signal is seen at early Ct values. When the baseline determination is chosen correctly for these specimens, a typical logarithmic increase in signal is seen.</span>
<br>

##### <span style="color: gray;">In this analysis, ~390 runs from May 2020 - January 2021 were checked for any errors in analyzing the data prior to export. Of these, 114 (29%) runs were found to have a problem with either the baseline determination or threshold selection</span>
<br>

##### <span style="color: red;">Upon analysis of this data, some inconsistencies were found that were due to re-exporting old data, that had been later rerun. When data for a given specimen was re-exported twice, the later run was kept. However, if a specimen was rerun and the rerun was not in the 29% of runs that were re-exported, the analysis was comparing old data to newer data. Since dates within the database are not always consistent with date run (especially prior to Apr21), dates could not be used to ensure only data from the same run was being compared. It is suggested for future studies to store the full run name in the database.</span>
##### <span style="color: red;">To attempt to account for this, all specimens with any data comments were removed from this version of the analysis. Another version includes these specimens.</span>

By identifying typos in sample IDs (e.g. the letter O instead of the numeral 0) 134 more specimens were matched. 10 additional specimens could not be unambiguously identified. The 134 specimens were added for the rest of this analysis for a total of 2651 specimens.</span>

#Want to remove entries that were rerun. E.g. 1st run inconclusive, 2nd run resulted but I only re-exported data from the 1st run. I can't compare that to the data in the database because it is from the 2nd run. Tried to filter by Run_Date and Date but these don't match. There are no dates prior to Apr21 in the database and many dates don't exactly match the actual run date. Instead decided to remove all with any dataComments, though this is not an exact way to do it. I don't think there IS an exact way to do it.

##This removes 258 entries - creating separate markdown file to run same code on this data.

### <span style="color: blue;">N1 Ct Comparison</span>
##### <span style="color: gray;">2393 specimens were compared from the original data (currently in EPICC database) with the new data (after baseline and threshold correction). Most of these fall on or close to the diagonal line on the scatter plot of x=y. 164 specimens (6.8%) have a difference greater than 3 Ct from the original data. These are outlined in purple on the plots. Of the 164 specimens, 34 had no N1 pop in the original data and had an N1 Ct < 40 in the new data as seen on the y axis. 11 had N1 Ct < 40 in the original data and have no N1 pop in the new data as seen on the x axis.</span>

* Largest number is **negative to inconclusive** (n=47). Not much concern here as these are unlikely to get good sequencing data. If any went from N1>36 to N1<36 they will be in the batch of newly sequenced specimens.
* **Inconclusive to positive** (n=24) and **invalid to positive** (n=1) are taken care of by the newly sequenced specimens if any went from N1>36 to N1<36
* **Positive to inconclusive** (10) and **positive to negative** (8) Viewed 10 of these individually when genome was >0. 
* **Inconclusive to negative** (n=5), **negative to invalid** (7), **invalid to negative** (5), and **invalid to inconclusive** (4) should not have a large impact on data analysis or interpretation
